# RED ONE MYSTERIUM-X
Disclaimer: This repository is for educational purposes only. 

I'm the proud owner of several RED ONE MX digital cinema cameras. Some of them work, and some don't. 
Unfortunately, these cameras (and the components within) are no longer able to be repaired by the manufactuer and very little (none) information exists on the Internet (or from the manufacture) that can assist with the debugging, repair, and calibration of RED ONE MX cameras.
